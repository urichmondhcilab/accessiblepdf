## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image features a series of box plots comparing two groups, labeled "Control" (light gray) and "Intervention" (dark gray), across five measures: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS (System Usability Scale).

**Observations:**

1. **Competency**:
   - Both groups show similar medians, with the Intervention group slightly higher.
   - Variability is similar for both groups.

2. **Autonomy**:
   - The Control group shows a slightly higher median than the Intervention group.
   - The spread of data is similar for both groups.

3. **Presence/Immersion**:
   - Both groups have similar medians and variability.
   - No notable difference between Control and Intervention.

4. **Intuitive Controls**:
   - The Intervention group has a noticeably higher median.
   - This measure is marked with a significance level (p < .05), indicating a statistically significant difference.

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**:
   - The Intervention group has a higher median compared to the Control group.
   - This measure is marked with a higher level of significance (p < .01), suggesting a highly statistically significant difference.

**Interpretations:**

- The intervention seems to have had a positive effect on intuitive controls and system usability, with statistically significant improvements noted in these areas.
- No significant differences are observed in competency, autonomy, and presence/immersion between the groups.
- The data suggests that the intervention might enhance user experience in terms of control intuitiveness and overall usability.

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph shows comparisons between control and intervention groups across several metrics.

1. **Competency**: Both groups have similar median scores, with slightly higher values for the intervention group.

2. **Autonomy**: There is little difference between the groups, with similar median values.

3. **Presence/Immersion**: The scores are almost identical between the groups.

4. **Intuitive Controls**: The intervention group has a higher median score compared to the control group, indicating a significant difference (p < .05).

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**: The intervention group also shows higher usability scores with significant difference (p < .01).

Overall, the intervention appears to improve intuitive controls and usability significantly.

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

In the dataset presented through the box plots, outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers of the box plots. In this data:

- **Competency:** No outliers are present for either control or intervention.
- **Autonomy:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Presence/Immersion:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Intuitive Controls:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **SUS:** There is an outlier for the control group, appearing below the lower whisker.

These outliers, particularly in the SUS control group, signify data points that deviate noticeably from the rest of the data.

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The image shows box plots comparing two conditions, "Control" and "Intervention," across five variables: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS. This type of plot does not specifically indicate the nature of the relationship (linear, exponential, etc.) between variables, but rather it shows the distribution and central tendency for each group.

To determine the type of relationship, you'd need more data, such as scatter plots, regression analysis, or other forms of correlation analysis. The box plots are primarily useful for visualizing differences in medians, ranges, and potential outliers within each variable and condition.
