## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image features a series of box plots comparing two groups, labeled "Control" (light gray) and "Intervention" (dark gray), across five measures: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS (System Usability Scale).

**Observations:**

1. **Competency**:
   - Both groups show similar medians, with the Intervention group slightly higher.
   - Variability is similar for both groups.

2. **Autonomy**:
   - The Control group shows a slightly higher median than the Intervention group.
   - The spread of data is similar for both groups.

3. **Presence/Immersion**:
   - Both groups have similar medians and variability.
   - No notable difference between Control and Intervention.

4. **Intuitive Controls**:
   - The Intervention group has a noticeably higher median.
   - This measure is marked with a significance level (p < .05), indicating a statistically significant difference.

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**:
   - The Intervention group has a higher median compared to the Control group.
   - This measure is marked with a higher level of significance (p < .01), suggesting a highly statistically significant difference.

**Interpretations:**

- The intervention seems to have had a positive effect on intuitive controls and system usability, with statistically significant improvements noted in these areas.
- No significant differences are observed in competency, autonomy, and presence/immersion between the groups.
- The data suggests that the intervention might enhance user experience in terms of control intuitiveness and overall usability.

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph shows comparisons between control and intervention groups across several metrics.

1. **Competency**: Both groups have similar median scores, with slightly higher values for the intervention group.

2. **Autonomy**: There is little difference between the groups, with similar median values.

3. **Presence/Immersion**: The scores are almost identical between the groups.

4. **Intuitive Controls**: The intervention group has a higher median score compared to the control group, indicating a significant difference (p < .05).

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**: The intervention group also shows higher usability scores with significant difference (p < .01).

Overall, the intervention appears to improve intuitive controls and usability significantly.

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

In the dataset presented through the box plots, outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers of the box plots. In this data:

- **Competency:** No outliers are present for either control or intervention.
- **Autonomy:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Presence/Immersion:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Intuitive Controls:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **SUS:** There is an outlier for the control group, appearing below the lower whisker.

These outliers, particularly in the SUS control group, signify data points that deviate noticeably from the rest of the data.

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The image shows box plots comparing two conditions, "Control" and "Intervention," across five variables: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS. This type of plot does not specifically indicate the nature of the relationship (linear, exponential, etc.) between variables, but rather it shows the distribution and central tendency for each group.

To determine the type of relationship, you'd need more data, such as scatter plots, regression analysis, or other forms of correlation analysis. The box plots are primarily useful for visualizing differences in medians, ranges, and potential outliers within each variable and condition.

## 5) Based on this trend, what would you expect to happen next?

The box plot indicates several findings from both control and intervention groups across different metrics:

1. **Competency & Autonomy**: The intervention group shows slightly higher medians compared to the control, but the difference is not statistically significant.

2. **Presence/Immersion**: There's little difference between the groups, suggesting the intervention didn't significantly impact this metric.

3. **Intuitive Controls**: The intervention group shows a significant improvement over the control group, indicated by the asterisk (p < .05).

4. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**: A significant improvement is observed in the intervention group (p < .01).

**Expectation**: If these trends continue, future interventions may further enhance the metrics where significant differences were observed, particularly in intuitive controls and usability. However, less impact might be seen on aspects like presence/immersion without substantial changes in approach.

## 6) What could be improved about this graph’s design?

Here are some suggestions for improving the graph’s design:

1. **Consistent Y-Axis Scaling**: Ensure that the y-axis scales are consistent across the different categories for easier comparison. Notice how the scales differ for categories on the left and right.

2. **Title and Labels**: Add a title to the graph for context. Also, consider using more descriptive labels for the x-axis and y-axis.

3. **Color Contrast**: Improve the color contrast between the boxes for clearer differentiation, especially for those with color vision deficiencies.

4. **Clarify Asterisks**: The asterisks indicating significance should have a consistent explanation, possibly including a legend or footnote with more detailed information on what they signify.

5. **Spacing and Alignment**: Align the boxes more consistently, and consider improving spacing to avoid confusion, especially where categories are closely placed.

6. **Gridlines**: Use subtle gridlines to help readers track values across the chart without cluttering the visual.

7. **Legend Placement**: Place the legend in a more prominent position to ensure it's easily associated with the graph. 

8. **Descriptors in Legend**: Ensure descriptors like "Control" and "Intervention" are clearly defined in the context of the study for clarity.

Implementing these changes could help improve readability and interpretability.

## 7) Would another chart type be better suited to show this data?

The box plot you provided is a good choice for showing distributions, medians, and variability across different categories. However, if you want to emphasize different aspects of the data, consider these options:

1. **Bar Chart**: If you're interested in highlighting average values between groups, a bar chart could be suitable. It’s less effective for showing variability.

2. **Violin Plot**: This could be useful to show the distribution shape of the data along with the range and medians, combining the benefits of box plots and density plots.

3. **Dot Plot**: Displays individual data points and can be useful for smaller data sets by showing all observations and their distribution.

Ultimately, the choice depends on what aspect of the data you want to emphasize. If highlighting median, spread, and presence of outliers is important, the box plot remains highly effective.

## 8) Does the scale or labeling introduce bias or confusion?

The image shows a set of box plots comparing control and intervention groups across five categories. Here’s an analysis of potential bias or confusion:

1. **Scale:**
   - The first four categories use a scale from 1 to 7, whereas the SUS (System Usability Scale) uses a scale from 0 to 100. This might be confusing if viewers are not familiar with the SUS typically using a different scale.
   - The difference in scales could cause misinterpretation if not clearly explained, as the interpretation of median and range values could vary significantly between scales.

2. **Labeling:**
   - Some categories are marked with an asterisk (*) indicating statistical significance (*p < .05 for "Intuitive Controls" and *p < .01 for "SUS"). This is useful, but viewers must know what the asterisk signifies to fully understand its importance.
   - The use of different shading for "Control" and "Intervention" groups is helpful for distinction, although some viewers may find it unclear without proper color differentiation if viewed in black and white or by individuals with color vision deficiencies.

To improve clarity:
- Ensure that viewers understand the scale differences through a legend or caption.
- Clarify what the asterisks mean with a note explaining the significance.
- Consider using distinct patterns or borders to differentiate groups for better accessibility.

## 9) Is this graph accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness? What improvements could be made to ensure the data is more inclusive and easier to interpret for all users?

The graph may present accessibility challenges for people with visual impairments or color blindness. Here are a few ways to make it more inclusive:

1. **High Contrast Colors**: Use high-contrast colors between the boxes for better visibility. Avoid relying solely on color to differentiate groups; instead, use patterns or textures.

2. **Labels and Annotations**: Ensure that all important data points are well-labeled. Adding direct annotations or data labels within or near the boxes can provide clarity.

3. **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alternative text or a caption that conveys the key information and findings of the graph.

4. **Legend Improvements**: If using colors, ensure that they are distinct even for those with color vision deficiencies. Consider using patterns as well as colors in the legend.

5. **Text Size and Font**: Use larger and more readable fonts for all labels, tick marks, and legends to help those with visual impairments.

6. **Interactive Features**: If possible, consider using interactive graphs where users can hover over elements to get more information.

Implementing these improvements can make the graph more accessible and easier to interpret for all users.
