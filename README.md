![Box plot comparison of Control vs. Intervention groups](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5eb7d28-3976-48ca-818a-a80dbbeccc27)

## 1) Graph Description & Interpretation

The image displays a series of box plots comparing two groups: **Control** (light gray) and **Intervention** (dark gray), across five measures:

- **Competency**
- **Autonomy**
- **Presence/Immersion**
- **Intuitive Controls**
- **SUS (System Usability Scale)**

### Observations

- **Competency**  
  Medians are similar, with the Intervention group slightly higher. Variability is consistent across both groups.

- **Autonomy**  
  Control has a slightly higher median. Spread is similar.

- **Presence/Immersion**  
  Medians and variability are nearly identical between groups.

- **Intuitive Controls**  
  Intervention group shows a higher median, with a statistically significant difference (*p* < .05).

- **SUS (System Usability Scale)**  
  Intervention group scores higher with a highly significant difference (*p* < .01).

### Interpretation

The intervention appears to improve **Intuitive Controls** and **System Usability**, both statistically significant. However, there is **no significant change** in Competency, Autonomy, or Presence/Immersion.

## 2) Summary of Trends

- **Competency**: Slight improvement in the intervention group.
- **Autonomy**: No meaningful difference.
- **Presence/Immersion**: Virtually the same across groups.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Intervention group performs better (*p* < .05).
- **SUS**: Markedly higher scores in the intervention group (*p* < .01).

ðŸ“ˆ **Conclusion:** The intervention enhances user experience by improving intuitive control and usability.
