## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image features a series of box plots comparing two groups, labeled "Control" (light gray) and "Intervention" (dark gray), across five measures: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS (System Usability Scale).

**Observations:**

1. **Competency**:
   - Both groups show similar medians, with the Intervention group slightly higher.
   - Variability is similar for both groups.

2. **Autonomy**:
   - The Control group shows a slightly higher median than the Intervention group.
   - The spread of data is similar for both groups.

3. **Presence/Immersion**:
   - Both groups have similar medians and variability.
   - No notable difference between Control and Intervention.

4. **Intuitive Controls**:
   - The Intervention group has a noticeably higher median.
   - This measure is marked with a significance level (p < .05), indicating a statistically significant difference.

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**:
   - The Intervention group has a higher median compared to the Control group.
   - This measure is marked with a higher level of significance (p < .01), suggesting a highly statistically significant difference.

**Interpretations:**

- The intervention seems to have had a positive effect on intuitive controls and system usability, with statistically significant improvements noted in these areas.
- No significant differences are observed in competency, autonomy, and presence/immersion between the groups.
- The data suggests that the intervention might enhance user experience in terms of control intuitiveness and overall usability.

---

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph shows comparisons between control and intervention groups across several metrics.

1. **Competency**: Both groups have similar median scores, with slightly higher values for the intervention group.

2. **Autonomy**: There is little difference between the groups, with similar median values.

3. **Presence/Immersion**: The scores are almost identical between the groups.

4. **Intuitive Controls**: The intervention group has a higher median score compared to the control group, indicating a significant difference (p < .05).

5. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**: The intervention group also shows higher usability scores with significant difference (p < .01).

Overall, the intervention appears to improve intuitive controls and usability significantly.

---

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

In the dataset presented through the box plots, outliers are shown as individual points beyond the whiskers of the box plots. In this data:

- **Competency:** No outliers are present for either control or intervention.
- **Autonomy:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Presence/Immersion:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **Intuitive Controls:** No outliers are present for either group.
- **SUS:** There is an outlier for the control group, appearing below the lower whisker.

These outliers, particularly in the SUS control group, signify data points that deviate noticeably from the rest of the data.

---

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The image shows box plots comparing two conditions, "Control" and "Intervention," across five variables: Competency, Autonomy, Presence/Immersion, Intuitive Controls, and SUS. This type of plot does not specifically indicate the nature of the relationship (linear, exponential, etc.) between variables, but rather it shows the distribution and central tendency for each group.

To determine the type of relationship, you'd need more data, such as scatter plots, regression analysis, or other forms of correlation analysis. The box plots are primarily useful for visualizing differences in medians, ranges, and potential outliers within each variable and condition.

---

## 5) Based on this trend, what would you expect to happen next?

The box plot indicates several findings from both control and intervention groups across different metrics:

1. **Competency & Autonomy**: The intervention group shows slightly higher medians compared to the control, but the difference is not statistically significant.

2. **Presence/Immersion**: There's little difference between the groups, suggesting the intervention didn't significantly impact this metric.

3. **Intuitive Controls**: The intervention group shows a significant improvement over the control group, indicated by the asterisk (p < .05).

4. **SUS (System Usability Scale)**: A significant improvement is observed in the intervention group (p < .01).

**Expectation**: If these trends continue, future interventions may further enhance the metrics where significant differences were observed, particularly in intuitive controls and usability. However, less impact might be seen on aspects like presence/immersion without substantial changes in approach.

---

## 6) What could be improved about this graph’s design?

Here are some suggestions for improving the graph’s design:

1. **Consistent Y-Axis Scaling**: Ensure that the y-axis scales are consistent across the different categories for easier comparison. Notice how the scales differ for categories on the left and right.

2. **Title and Labels**: Add a title to the graph for context. Also, consider using more descriptive labels for the x-axis and y-axis.

3. **Color Contrast**: Improve the color contrast between the boxes for clearer differentiation, especially for those with color vision deficiencies.

4. **Clarify Asterisks**: The asterisks indicating significance should have a consistent explanation, possibly including a legend or footnote with more detailed information on what they signify.

5. **Spacing and Alignment**: Align the boxes more consistently, and consider improving spacing to avoid confusion, especially where categories are closely placed.

6. **Gridlines**: Use subtle gridlines to help readers track values across the chart without cluttering the visual.

7. **Legend Placement**: Place the legend in a more prominent position to ensure it's easily associated with the graph. 

8. **Descriptors in Legend**: Ensure descriptors like "Control" and "Intervention" are clearly defined in the context of the study for clarity.

Implementing these changes could help improve readability and interpretability.

---

## 7) Would another chart type be better suited to show this data?

The box plot you provided is a good choice for showing distributions, medians, and variability across different categories. However, if you want to emphasize different aspects of the data, consider these options:

1. **Bar Chart**: If you're interested in highlighting average values between groups, a bar chart could be suitable. It’s less effective for showing variability.

2. **Violin Plot**: This could be useful to show the distribution shape of the data along with the range and medians, combining the benefits of box plots and density plots.

3. **Dot Plot**: Displays individual data points and can be useful for smaller data sets by showing all observations and their distribution.

Ultimately, the choice depends on what aspect of the data you want to emphasize. If highlighting median, spread, and presence of outliers is important, the box plot remains highly effective.

---

## 8) Does the scale or labeling introduce bias or confusion?

The image shows a set of box plots comparing control and intervention groups across five categories. Here’s an analysis of potential bias or confusion:

1. **Scale:**
   - The first four categories use a scale from 1 to 7, whereas the SUS (System Usability Scale) uses a scale from 0 to 100. This might be confusing if viewers are not familiar with the SUS typically using a different scale.
   - The difference in scales could cause misinterpretation if not clearly explained, as the interpretation of median and range values could vary significantly between scales.

2. **Labeling:**
   - Some categories are marked with an asterisk (*) indicating statistical significance (*p < .05 for "Intuitive Controls" and *p < .01 for "SUS"). This is useful, but viewers must know what the asterisk signifies to fully understand its importance.
   - The use of different shading for "Control" and "Intervention" groups is helpful for distinction, although some viewers may find it unclear without proper color differentiation if viewed in black and white or by individuals with color vision deficiencies.

To improve clarity:
- Ensure that viewers understand the scale differences through a legend or caption.
- Clarify what the asterisks mean with a note explaining the significance.
- Consider using distinct patterns or borders to differentiate groups for better accessibility.

---

## 9) Is this graph accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness? What improvements could be made to ensure the data is more inclusive and easier to interpret for all users?

The graph may present accessibility challenges for people with visual impairments or color blindness. Here are a few ways to make it more inclusive:

1. **High Contrast Colors**: Use high-contrast colors between the boxes for better visibility. Avoid relying solely on color to differentiate groups; instead, use patterns or textures.

2. **Labels and Annotations**: Ensure that all important data points are well-labeled. Adding direct annotations or data labels within or near the boxes can provide clarity.

3. **Alternative Text**: Provide descriptive alternative text or a caption that conveys the key information and findings of the graph.

4. **Legend Improvements**: If using colors, ensure that they are distinct even for those with color vision deficiencies. Consider using patterns as well as colors in the legend.

5. **Text Size and Font**: Use larger and more readable fonts for all labels, tick marks, and legends to help those with visual impairments.

6. **Interactive Features**: If possible, consider using interactive graphs where users can hover over elements to get more information.

Implementing these improvements can make the graph more accessible and easier to interpret for all users.

## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image is a graph showing the relationship between movement time (in seconds) and index of difficulty for three input spaces: Elbow-Plane, Shoulder-Plane, and Elbow-Sphere. Each input space is represented by a different colored line with corresponding data points (red, green, and blue).

Interpretations from the graph:

1. **Positive Correlation**: All input spaces show a positive correlation between movement time and index of difficulty, indicating that as tasks become more difficult, movement time increases.

2. **Linear Trend**: The lines depict a linear trend, represented by linear equations for each input space, with small variances in their slopes and intercepts.

3. **Performance Comparison**:
   - The Elbow-Plane (red) and Elbow-Sphere (blue) perform very similarly, with slightly faster movement times compared to Shoulder-Plane (green) at higher difficulty levels.
   - Shoulder-Plane shows a slightly higher intercept, indicating slightly longer initial movement times.

4. **Adjusted R²**: The adjusted R² value is 0.912, suggesting a high degree of fit for the linear model to the data.

Overall, the graph suggests consistent increases in movement time with increased task difficulty across the different input spaces, with Elbow-Plane and Elbow-Sphere being slightly more efficient than Shoulder-Plane.

---

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph shows the relationship between movement time and index of difficulty across three input spaces: Elbow-Plane, Shoulder-Plane, and Elbow-Sphere. 

Key trends include:

1. **Linear Increase**: Movement time increases linearly with the index of difficulty for all three input spaces.

2. **Similar Patterns**: The Elbow-Plane and Elbow-Sphere have very similar slopes, indicating a similar rate of increase in movement time as difficulty increases. The Shoulder-Plane has a slightly lower slope.

3. **Intercepts and Slopes**:
   - **Elbow-Plane**: \(MT = 0.756 + 0.389 \times IC\)
   - **Shoulder-Plane**: \(MT = 0.830 + 0.379 \times IC\)
   - **Elbow-Sphere**: \(MT = 0.768 + 0.405 \times IC\)

4. **Good Fit**: The adjusted R² value of 0.912 indicates a strong fit of the linear models to the data.

In summary, all input spaces show a consistent increase in movement time with increased difficulty, with slight variations in intercepts and slopes.

---

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

In this dataset, several points appear to be outliers, particularly those scattered farther from the trend lines. Specifically, these are:

1. At an index of difficulty (ID) of 3, a green point (Shoulder-Plane) is noticeably above the other points.
2. At an ID of 4, another green point is above the main cluster.
3. At an ID of 5, there are a few green points above the trend line.

These suggest some variance in measurements for the Shoulder-Plane input space specifically.

---

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The relationship between the variables is linear. This is indicated by the linear equations provided for the three different conditions and the straight lines shown in the graph. Each equation is in the form \(MT = a + b \times IC\), which represents a linear relationship between Movement Time (MT) and Index of Difficulty (IC). The high adjusted \(R^2\) value of 0.912 further supports that a linear model fits the data well.

---

## 5) Based on this trend, what would you expect to happen next?

The graph shows movement time (MT) increasing linearly with the index of difficulty (IC) across different input spaces: Elbow-Plane, Shoulder-Plane, and Elbow-Sphere. The trend lines suggest that as the difficulty increases, the movement time will continue to rise linearly for each input space.

All three input spaces have similar slopes, indicating comparable performance across them as difficulty increases. With an adjusted \( R^2 \) of 0.912, the linear models fit the data well.

I would expect that if the index of difficulty were to increase beyond 5, the movement time would continue to increase linearly in a similar manner for each input space.

---

## 6) What could be improved about this graph’s design?

To improve the graph's design, consider the following enhancements:

1. **Increase Contrast**: Ensure there is a higher contrast between the colors for better visibility, especially for those with color vision deficiencies.

2. **Line Thickness**: Reduce the thickness of the lines slightly to make the overlapping data points clearer.

3. **Data Point Visibility**: Use more distinct shapes or increase the size of data points to differentiate them better from the lines.

4. **Grid Lines**: Lighten grid lines so they don’t distract from the data.

5. **Legend Position**: Move the legend to the bottom to minimize overlap with the graph and make it more readable.

6. **Font Size**: Uniformly increase font size for better readability.

7. **Axis Labels**: Make the axis labels bolder to stand out more against the grid and data points.

8. **Clarity**: Include a brief description or title for context on what the graph represents.

By applying these changes, the graph can become clearer and more effective in communicating the data.

---

## 7) Would another chart type be better suited to show this data?

The given scatter plot with regression lines is appropriate for showing the relationship between movement time and index of difficulty for different input spaces. It effectively illustrates the trends and the differences between the three conditions (Elbow-Plane, Shoulder-Plane, Elbow-Sphere).

If you want to explore alternative visualizations, consider these options depending on your focus:

1. **Line Graph:** If you are more interested in showing the trends across the conditions without the individual data points.
   
2. **Bar Chart with Error Bars:** If you have summary statistics (e.g., mean and standard deviation) for each index of difficulty and want to emphasize comparisons more clearly.

3. **Box Plot:** Useful for showing the distribution of data (median, quartiles), especially if there are outliers you want to highlight.

Each option comes with trade-offs, so the best choice depends on what you wish to emphasize in your analysis.

---

## 8) Does the scale or labeling introduce bias or confusion?

The scale and labeling in the graph appear to be clear and consistent. Here are some observations:

1. **Axis Labels:**
   - The x-axis is labeled as "Index of difficulty" and is clear with values 1 to 5.
   - The y-axis is labeled as "Movement time (seconds)" with a starting point of 1.0, which is appropriate for the data being presented.

2. **Legend and Lines:**
   - The legend clearly differentiates between the three input spaces (Elbow-Plane, Shoulder-Plane, Elbow-Sphere) using distinct colors and line styles, which are consistently applied in the graph.
   - Regression lines with equations are provided for each group, which can help in understanding the trends.

3. **R² Value:**
   - The adjusted \( R^2 = 0.912 \) is included, indicating a good fit of the model to the data and provides additional context.

Overall, there does not seem to be any substantial bias or confusion introduced by the scale or labeling. However, ensuring that the audience understands what "Index of difficulty" and "Input Space" mean is vital for interpretation.

---

## 9) Is this graph accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness? What improvements could be made to ensure the data is more inclusive and easier to interpret for all users?

To make the graph more accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness, consider the following improvements:

1. **High Contrast**: Ensure that colors used are high contrast against the background for better visibility.

2. **Textures or Patterns**: Use different line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) or patterns for the different groups instead of relying solely on color.

3. **Larger Text and Labels**: Increase the size of axis labels, legends, and text for easier reading.

4. **Descriptive Labels**: Use descriptive text labels directly on or near the lines, indicating their group.

5. **Alternative Text**: Provide a textual description of the graph and its data in any accompanying materials or HTML alt text.

6. **Colorblind-Friendly Palette**: Use a color palette that is distinguishable for common types of color blindness (e.g., red-green color blindness).

7. **Shapes and Symbols**: Incorporate different shapes or symbols for data points to differentiate them beyond color.

Implementing these changes can significantly enhance readability and accessibility for all users.

---

## Summary 

8. The AI goes through describing all the labeling, sometimes being more specific than other times. For example with the y-axis it could have included not only the starting point is 1.0 but also that the ending point is 3.0. A good point was made that it is important for the users’s to understand what "Index of difficulty" and "Input Space" are. 

9. Was hit or miss with the suggestions, often leaving out specific details on how to imporve. For instance, high contrast isn’t necessarily relevant for the graph. Although the recommendation of using different patterns for the lines is a good suggestion. I am not sure how AI is deciphering what is considered “large” enough text. I thought Descriptive Labels wasn’t a very helpful suggestion, and it didn’t make much sense if implemented. Having Alternative Text as a recommendation is a good reminder but there isn’t currently a way for the AI to know if the image has/doesn’t have the Alt text already. Colorblind-Friendly Palette is a good suggestion but it wasn’t specific on which colors the graph should use instead or if the graph’s colors were sufficient enough. Different Shapes and Symbols for the data points is a very good suggestion.

## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image is a flowchart illustrating the process of selecting research papers for analysis, divided into four main phases: Identification, Screening, Eligibility, and Inclusion.

1. **Identification**:
   - Papers were gathered from two sources: ACM Digital Library (1,352 papers) and Web of Science (316 papers), totaling 1,668 papers.

2. **Screening**:
   - From the total, 755 papers were excluded due to reasons like duplication, non-peer review, non-English language, short length, symposium titles, theses/dissertations, and book titles.
   - This resulted in 913 papers being reviewed by titles, abstracts, and keywords.
   - 675 papers were further excluded for not fitting the research scope.

3. **Eligibility**:
   - 238 full-text papers were reviewed.
   - 154 papers were excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria.

4. **Inclusion**:
   - A total of 84 papers were included in the final analysis.
   - These were categorized into framework concepts: Basic (25), Safety (31), Relationship (26), Self-Esteem (8), and Self-Actualization (4).

This flowchart represents a systematic review method, showing how a large number of initial papers were narrowed down to a few that met specific criteria and categories for in-depth analysis.

---

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph represents the process of filtering academic papers for analysis:

1. **Identification**: 
   - 1,352 papers from ACM Digital Library and 316 from Web of Science, totaling 1,668 papers.

2. **Screening**:
   - 755 papers excluded due to duplication, non-peer review, language issues, short length, symposium titles, thesis/dissertation, and book titles.
   - 913 papers remained for title, abstract, and keyword review.

3. **Eligibility**:
   - 675 papers excluded for not fitting the scope.
   - 238 papers had their full texts reviewed.

4. **Included**:
   - 154 papers excluded for failing to meet inclusion criteria.
   - 84 papers were included in the analysis.

5. **Breakdown by Framework Concepts**:
   - Basic: 25 papers
   - Safety: 31 papers
   - Relationship: 26 papers
   - Self-Esteem: 8 papers
   - Self-Actualization: 4 papers

The majority of exclusions occurred during the screening process due to mismatch in scope and initial criteria.

---

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

To identify potential outliers in this dataset, we need to follow the flow of papers through the stages:

1. **Identification**: 
   - Total papers returned from both sources = 1,668.

2. **Screening**:
   - Papers excluded at this stage = 755.
   - Remaining papers after screening = 913.

3. **Eligibility**:
   - Papers excluded for not fitting scope = 675.
   - Full-text reviews conducted on = 238 papers.
   - Papers excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria = 154.

4. **Included**: 
   - Papers included in analysis = 84.

### Observations:
- The exclusion numbers and remaining paper counts appear consistent with expected reductions at each stage.
- The final breakdown by framework concepts:
  - Basic = 25
  - Safety = 31
  - Relationship = 26
  - Self-Esteem = 8
  - Self-Actualization = 4

The dataset itself does not show numerical outliers in the process. Each stage logically reduces from the prior, with no unexpected jumps in the flow. The distribution among framework concepts ranges from 4 to 31, indicating a reasonable spread given the filters applied. There don’t seem to be any statistical outliers presented.

---

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The image depicts a flowchart of a research paper selection process. It's not about quantitative relationships between variables like linear or exponential growth. Instead, it shows a sequential filtering process: starting with 1,668 papers, reducing through several exclusion steps to 84 papers for analysis. Each step is based on criteria, not mathematical relationships.

---

## 5) Based on this trend, what would you expect to happen next?

The flowchart illustrates a systematic review process for selecting academic papers. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identification**: Initially, papers are gathered from two sources, ACM Digital Library and Web of Science, totaling 1,668 papers.

2. **Screening**: 
   - 755 papers are excluded for reasons like duplication, non-peer review status, non-English language, etc., leaving 913 papers.
   - Titles, abstracts, and author keywords are reviewed, excluding 675 papers not fitting the scope, resulting in 238 papers.

3. **Eligibility**: 
   - Out of the 238 full texts reviewed, 154 are excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, leaving 84 papers.

4. **Included**: 
   - Finally, 84 papers are included in the analysis.

Given this structured process, the next step would likely involve a detailed analysis of the 84 papers, focusing on their findings, methodologies, and contributions. The breakdown by framework concepts suggests categorizing and exploring insights related to these themes. Analysis and synthesis, possibly resulting in reports or further publications, would be expected continuation actions.

---

## 6) What could be improved about this graph’s design?

The graph design could be improved in several ways:

1. **Color Contrast**: Ensure that the color contrast is high enough for better readability. The colors used for rejecting papers are similar, which might not be clear to colorblind users.

2. **Consistency in Alignment**: The alignment of elements within sections could be improved for a cleaner look. Make sure all boxes and arrows are uniformly aligned.

3. **Size and Spacing**: Ensure that all text and elements have consistent size and spacing throughout for a more balanced appearance.

4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use varying text sizes or styles (e.g., bold) to differentiate between titles, subtitles, and other text to create a clearer visual hierarchy.

5. **Simplicity in Arrows**: Arrows should be simpler and more direct, reducing clutter and making the flow easier to follow.

6. **Text Clarity**: Avoid overly technical terms in the exclusion criteria, if possible, for better accessibility and understanding.

7. **Legend or Key**: Consider adding a legend or key explaining the color scheme and used symbols (if colors have specific meanings).

8. **Accessible Fonts**: Use fonts that are accessible and easy to read, especially for larger sizes.

Implementing these changes can enhance clarity and readability, making the information easier to process.

---

## 7) Would another chart type be better suited to show this data?

The flowchart you provided is well-suited for illustrating the systematic review process, showing how papers were screened and included or excluded at each step. However, if you want to emphasize specific data points, other chart types might complement the flowchart:

1. **Pie Chart or Bar Chart**: To show the percentage breakdown of papers excluded at each screening step, which can provide a quick visual of where most papers were excluded.

2. **Stacked Bar Chart**: To illustrate the breakdown by framework concepts in the included papers. This would highlight proportions and make comparisons easier.

3. **Sankey Diagram**: To represent the flow of papers through the process with a more visual emphasis on the movement from one category to another.

Each of these charts can provide additional insights depending on what aspect of the data you want to highlight.

---

## 8) Does the scale or labeling introduce bias or confusion?

The flowchart appears to be clear and systematic with a well-defined progression through the stages of identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion. However, here are a few points to consider regarding potential confusion or bias:

1. **Labeling Clarity**:
   - The labels are generally clear about the exclusion criteria at each step. There doesn't seem to be a bias, but ensuring that all exclusion criteria are precise and comprehensive is important.

2. **Data Sources**:
   - The labeling of data sources (ACM Digital Library and Web of Science) is clear, but any differences in the criteria used by these databases should be transparent if they influence what gets included or excluded.

3. **Exclusion Reasons**:
   - The reasons for exclusions (e.g., non-peer-reviewed, short length) are specific, minimizing confusion. However, some might see subjective elements in defining “short length” or “not fitting scope.”

4. **Framework Concepts**:
   - The breakdown by framework concepts is detailed. However, it's important to ensure these classifications are consistently defined and applied to prevent interpretive bias.

Overall, the flowchart does a good job of minimizing confusion and bias through concise and well-organized presentation.

---

## 9) Is this graph accessible to people with visual impairments or color blindness? What improvements could be made to ensure the data is more inclusive and easier to interpret for all users?

To ensure this flowchart is accessible for people with visual impairments or color blindness, consider the following improvements:

1. **Text Clarity:**
   - Ensure all text is easily readable with a suitable font size and type.
   - Provide high contrast between text and background colors.

2. **Color Accessibility:**
   - Use patterns or textures in addition to colors to differentiate sections.
   - Ensure colors used are distinguishable by color-blind users (e.g., avoid red-green combinations).

3. **Alternative Text:**
   - Provide descriptive alt text for the graph explaining the flow and data.

4. **Screen Reader Compatibility:**
   - Structure the chart so it is navigable using a screen reader. Include logical reading order and descriptions.

5. **Simplify Layout:**
   - Consider simplifying the design if possible, to avoid unnecessary complexity.

6. **Interactive Features:**
   - If digital, allow users to click on sections for more detailed, textual data.

7. **Use of Labels:**
   - Include clear, descriptive labels for each node and decision point.

Implementing these changes can make the chart more inclusive and accessible to a wider audience.

## 1) Describe the image and what can be interpreted from it.

The image is a timeline chart showing the progression and interrelation of various research studies from 1975 to 2020. It is divided by a dashed line labeled "interactive virtual divide," suggesting a conceptual separation between different research approaches. The studies are color-coded into four categories:

1. **Non-interactive media studies (Teal):** Includes studies positioned above the divide, indicating a focus on non-interactive media, such as those by Hawkins (1975), Potter (1980), and others.

2. **Games research (Green):** Positioned both above and below the divide, indicating both interactive and non-interactive aspects; for example, Busse & Greenberg (1992) and others extending to 2020.

3. **Simulator research (Yellow):** Among research studies situated below the divide, from Fink & Shriver (1978) to Longford & Dixon and Witmer & Singer (1995), indicating simulator research focus.

4. **CAVE systems and VR research (Green):** Focused on immersive technologies, often situated below the divide, such as Galloway (2004) and advancing towards 2020.

The chart shows the evolution and interrelation of these studies, suggesting how research in different fields has progressed and branched over time, with some overlapping or contributing to others.

---

## 2) Summarize trends in the graph.

The graph presents trends in research areas from 1975 to 2020, categorized into five areas: non-interactive media studies, games research, simulator research, and CAVE systems and VR research.

1. **Non-Interactive Media Studies (Blue)**
   - Concentrated mainly between 1975 and 2000.
   - Key contributors: Hawkins, Potter, and Hall.

2. **Games Research (Teal)**
   - Steady growth starting in the late 1990s.
   - A notable increase in publications into the 2000s and onwards.
   - Significant studies by Popova, Lin & Peng, and Rooney et al.

3. **Simulator Research (Yellow)**
   - Limited data points with key contributions around the early 1980s to 2000.
   - Notable researchers include Rahman and Andrews et al.

4. **CAVE Systems and VR Research (Green)**
   - Gained momentum in the 1990s, expanding significantly into the 2000s and beyond.
   - Major contributions by Slater et al., Gaggioli et al., and Blascovich et al.

Overall, the trends show a gradual shift towards interactive virtual reality systems and VR research over the years, with increasing interdisciplinarity in games research. The "interactive virtual divide" line illustrates the transition from non-interactive to interactive media studies.

---

## 3) What outliers, if any, are present in this dataset?

In this dataset, potential outliers can be identified based on their position relative to the "interactive virtual divide" dashed line. These outliers may be:

1. The "Potter" point in non-interactive media studies (cyan), located significantly below the line in the early '80s.
2. The "Lonbord & Ditton" point in simulator research (yellow), positioned well above the line around 1995.

These points deviate from the general trend observed in other datasets relative to the interactive divide.

---

## 4) Is the relationship between the variables linear, exponential, or something else?

The relationship between the variables appears to be more complex and not strictly linear or exponential. The graph shows the development of different research areas over time, such as non-interactive media studies, games research, simulator research, and VR research. Each category is represented with a different color, and the progression is not uniform across all areas. There are trends and clusters, but no clear single mathematical relationship like a linear or exponential model fits all the data.
